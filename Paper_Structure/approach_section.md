## IV. Approach (Methodology)

### A. `NormSelector` Design and Implementation
The core of our adaptive normalization mechanism is the `NormSelector`, a novel component designed to dynamically blend or select between different normalization techniques. Architecturally, the `NormSelector` is implemented as a small Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that takes input features and processes them to produce softmax-derived weights. These weights, denoted as $w_0$ and $w_1$, are then used to combine the outputs of Dynamic Transformer Normalization (DyT) and Layer Normalization (LN). The mathematical formulation for the `NormSelector`'s output is given by:

$\text{Output} = w_0 \cdot DyT(x) + w_1 \cdot LN(x)$

where $x$ represents the input features, $DyT(x)$ is the output of the Dynamic Transformer Normalization, and $LN(x)$ is the output of Layer Normalization. The weights $w_0$ and $w_1$ are dynamically generated by the MLP and normalized via a softmax function, ensuring that their sum is 1.

For comprehensive ablation studies, the `NormSelector` supports two specialized modes:
1.  `disable_selector`: In this mode, the `NormSelector` is effectively bypassed, and the model exclusively utilizes Layer Normalization. This allows us to evaluate the baseline performance of a Transformer model with traditional Layer Normalization.
2.  `random_selector`: This mode assigns random weights to $DyT(x)$ and $LN(x)$ at each step, providing a stochastic baseline to assess whether the learned adaptive weighting by the MLP offers a significant advantage over arbitrary combinations.

### B. `TransformerWithAutoNorm` Architecture
The `TransformerWithAutoNorm` architecture integrates the novel `NormSelector` within its Transformer blocks to enable adaptive normalization. Each Transformer block is modified to incorporate the `NormSelector` after the multi-head attention and feed-forward network layers, allowing for dynamic adjustment of normalization based on the input features.

The architecture also leverages several essential utility modules:
*   `DropPath`: Implements stochastic depth, a regularization technique that randomly drops paths within the network during training, enhancing generalization.
*   `PatchEmbedding`: Converts input images into a sequence of flattened patches, which are then linearly projected to the model's hidden dimension, a standard practice in Vision Transformers.
*   `DyT` (Dynamic Transformer Normalization): A simple learnable scaling mechanism defined as $DyT(x) = x \odot \alpha$, where $\alpha$ is a learnable parameter. This provides an alternative normalization approach to Layer Normalization.
*   `SE` (Squeeze-and-Excitation) blocks: These modules are integrated to allow the model to perform dynamic channel-wise feature recalibration, enhancing the representational power of the network.

For comprehensive ablation studies, we developed specialized models:
*   `FrozenDyTTransformer`: This model exclusively uses DyT normalization throughout its Transformer blocks, with the `NormSelector` effectively disabled to only output DyT. This allows for direct comparison against `AutoNorm` to understand the benefits of adaptive blending.
*   `FrozenLNTransformer`: Similar to `FrozenDyTTransformer`, this model uses only Layer Normalization, with the `NormSelector` configured to exclusively output LN. This serves as a strong baseline representing traditional Transformer normalization.

### C. Experimental Setup
Our experimental setup is designed to rigorously evaluate the performance, robustness, and efficiency of `AutoNorm` across a diverse range of tasks and against various baselines.

#### 1. Datasets
We utilize a comprehensive suite of datasets, categorized by task type:
*   **Classification**:
    *   MNIST: A dataset of handwritten digits.
    *   CIFAR10: A dataset of 32x32 color images across 10 classes.
    *   FashionMNIST: A dataset of Zalando's article images, serving as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST.
    *   SVHN (Street View House Numbers): A dataset of real-world house numbers obtained from Google Street View images.
*   **Regression**:
    *   EnergyEfficiency: A dataset used for predicting heating and cooling loads of buildings.
*   **Pretraining**:
    *   CIFAR100: An extension of CIFAR10 with 100 classes, used for pretraining models before finetuning on downstream tasks.
    *   CaliforniaHousing: A dataset containing median house values for districts in California, used for pretraining regression models.

#### 2. Baselines for Comparison
To thoroughly assess `AutoNorm`, we compare its performance against several carefully selected baselines:
*   `AutoNorm_DisableSelector`: This baseline effectively operates as a Layer Normalization-only model, as the `NormSelector` is configured to always output Layer Normalization.
*   `AutoNorm_RandomSelector`: In this baseline, the `NormSelector` assigns random weights to DyT and LN, providing a stochastic control to evaluate the benefit of learned adaptive weighting.
*   `FrozenDyT`: A model that exclusively uses Dynamic Transformer Normalization (DyT) throughout its architecture.
*   `FrozenLN`: A model that exclusively uses Layer Normalization (LN) throughout its architecture, representing the standard Transformer normalization.
*   `Teacher` model: A simpler, often smaller, baseline model used in knowledge distillation setups to provide a performance reference and to guide student models.

#### 3. Training Regimen and Hyperparameters
Our training regimen incorporates advanced optimization and regularization techniques to ensure robust and high-performance models:
*   **Optimization**: We employ the AdamW optimizer with a cosine learning rate scheduling strategy, including a warmup phase to stabilize early training.
*   **Regularization**: To prevent overfitting and improve generalization, we utilize:
    *   MixUp and CutMix: Data augmentation techniques that create new training samples by linearly combining pairs of examples and their labels.
    *   Label smoothing: A regularization technique that encourages the model to be less confident in its predictions.
    *   DropPath (stochastic depth): Randomly drops paths within the network during training.
*   **Model Averaging**: Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is applied to model weights, which often leads to improved generalization and more stable performance.
*   **Early stopping criteria**: Training is halted if validation performance does not improve for a specified number of epochs, preventing overfitting and saving computational resources.
*   **Knowledge Distillation setup**: Student models are trained to mimic the outputs of a pre-trained `Teacher` model, leveraging the teacher's knowledge to improve student performance.
*   **Progressive Finetuning strategy**: A two-phase transfer learning approach where models are first finetuned with only the classification/regression head active, followed by a full finetune of the entire model.

#### 4. Evaluation Metrics
We use a comprehensive set of metrics tailored to each task type:
*   **Classification**:
    *   Accuracy: The primary metric for classification performance.
    *   Robustness to noise and rotation: Evaluated using corrupted test loaders (e.g., Gaussian noise, random rotations) to assess model stability under perturbed inputs.
*   **Regression**:
    *   Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Measures the average magnitude of the errors.
    *   Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of the errors without considering their direction.
*   **Efficiency**:
    *   FLOPs (Floating Point Operations): Quantifies the computational cost of the model.
    *   Latency: Measures the time taken for the model to process an input, indicating inference speed.

### D. Implementation Details
The entire `AutoNorm` project, including the `NormSelector`, `TransformerWithAutoNorm` architecture, and all experimental setups, is implemented using **Python**. The primary deep learning framework utilized is **PyTorch**, known for its flexibility and dynamic computational graph capabilities.

All training and evaluation procedures were conducted on a cluster equipped with **NVIDIA V100 GPUs**. Specific hardware configurations, including the number of GPUs and CPU resources, were allocated based on the scale of each experiment to ensure efficient execution and reproducibility.
