# VI. Conclusion

## A. Summary of Key Findings
1. The `AutoNorm` project successfully implements and evaluates an adaptive normalization approach for Transformer models.
2. `AutoNorm` and its variants demonstrate strong performance compared to a simpler `Teacher` baseline across various tasks.
3. The adaptive `NormSelector` does not consistently outperform fixed normalization strategies (DyT, LN) across all tasks and metrics, suggesting task-dependent optimality.

## B. Discussion and Implications
1. The optimal normalization strategy can be dataset-dependent, highlighting the complexity of adaptive mechanisms.
2. The `NormSelector` provides a flexible framework, but its current learning mechanism may require further refinement.
3. Trade-offs between adaptivity, performance, and computational efficiency.

## C. Limitations
1. Evaluation limited to specific classification and regression datasets.
2. The `NormSelector` design is a specific adaptive approach; other adaptive strategies could be explored.
3. The `Teacher` model used as a baseline is simpler, and comparison with more advanced baselines could provide further insights.

## D. Future Work
1. Investigate alternative learning mechanisms for the `NormSelector` to improve its adaptivity and consistency.
2. Apply `AutoNorm` in more complex Transformer architectures and larger-scale datasets.
3. Explore the combination of `NormSelector` with other adaptive components within Transformer models.
4. Conduct a deeper theoretical analysis of the `NormSelector`'s behavior and its interaction with different data distributions.
